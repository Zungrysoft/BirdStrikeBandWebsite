Four poor wretches struggling to make it as single childless software engineers.\n\nIn the days before Alex joined, the band was creating its vocal tracks by cutting together audio snippets of Joe Rogan interviews. Tired of having to do this, Calvin hired his brother Alex to cut together the Joe Rogan snippets for them. But then he came up with a better way.`}

                description={`After their previous guitarist Tom's untimely death, the band performed an ancient Portugese ritual passed down by Calvin and Alex's grandmother to transplant his soul and guitar-playing ability into another man's body. The band chose Kern as the victim shell in order to raise the band's average attractiveness and get a head start on their plan to transition into a K-Pop group so gradually that no one would notice. Half way through the ritual which took the form of a 9-part prog metal opera, Tom (in Kern's body) leapt up from the ceremonial cot, grabbed his guitar, and began shredding!\n\nThe band found out later that the ritual didn't actually work; Kern had in fact been playing guitar for over 13 years. But he seemed like a nice enough guy so the band let him stay. Though they remind him that if he slips up once too many, they can always do the ritual again (and get it right this time.)`}

                description={`Calvin has been perfecting his overdriven Hammond Organ tone to create a screaming beastly rival to the power of Tom's guitar. A common sight at a Bird Strike show is the other four members waiting impatiently between songs for him to remember which of the 500 controls on his custom rig he needs to adjust to set up for the next song.\n\nThe band originally formed when Calvin hosted a seminar to rope suckers into his cryptocurrency scheme. But when only two people showed up, he abandoned the idea and turned it into a jam session instead. And it's a good thing too because buying audio equipment for Bird Strike allows them to hemorrhage money just a little bit slower than if they had invested in crypto.\n\nCalvin shows up to practice every week brimming with new ideas for new songs, or at least brimming with excuses for why he didn't get anything done last week. He suffers no fools, asks no quarter, and arrives to no practice session sober; for he is a founding member of Bird Strike first, last, and always.`}

He barely even gets time to play his instrument. (And it shows.) Whether Bird Strike is playing a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden or in a dive bar in West Oakland occupied only by two regulars taking greater interest in their whiskey sours, it was Alan who knew which palms to grease to make it happen.\n\nAlan's complex and intricate basslines put to shame lesser bassists who haven't touched their D and G strings since the Clinton administration. His unique style of bass playing requires a lot of imagination, though mostly because he's turned down so low that you have to imagine what he's playing.`}

As a founding member of Bird Strike (formerly known as *bandName*), he brought to every practice session some dirty licks, some clean solos, and just a little bit of workout stank.\n\nTom's rise to fame was cut short by his tragic death in August of 2025. For the sake of the family's privacy, the band wishes not to go into much detail, but they will say that it involved the Sinaloa Cartel, a Hattori Hanzo sword, and three slices of provolone cheese.`}
